        Through the analysis of mass shooting data collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center, our team attempted to understand
         the basic questions of where these shootings occurred and if certain things imcreased the chances of one happening.
          Utlizing the Census and numerous organizations' efforts to track and establish a record of these instances, we 
          looked for insight into the following questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have mass shooting rates increased over the years?</li>
        <li>Where are mass shootings happening most often and where are they the deadliest?</li>
        <li>Does gun legislation have any relationship to number of mass shootings?</li>
        <li>Does hate group activity have any relationship with number of mass shootings?</li>
    </ul>

                <li><h4>Mass Shooting Definition: </h4>4+ victims injured or killed excluding the subject/suspect/perpetrator, one location. (Gun Violence Archive)</li>
                <li><h4>Hate Group Definition: </h4>An organization that – based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its
                    activities – has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable
                    characteristics. (Southern Poverty Law Center)</li>
                <li><h4>Region Definitions: </h4>
                    <ul class="defList">
                        <li>Urban - Region with a density greater than 3000 ppl / sq mi</li>
                        <li>Suburban - Region with a density greater than 1000 ppl / sq mi but less than 3000 ppl / sq mi</li>
                        <li>Rural - Region with a density less than 1000 ppl / sq mi</li>

                <li><h4>State Gun Laws: </h4>Attorneys track and analyze gun legislation in all 50 states, evaluating bills for their relative strength or
                    weakness. Taking note of newly enacted laws, they use an exhaustive quantitative rubric to score each state
                    on its gun law strength, adding points for safety regulations like universal background checks and extreme risk
                    protection orders and subtracting points for reckless policies like “Stand Your Ground” and permitless carry
                    laws. (Giffords Law Center)</li>
