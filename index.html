    Data, math, structure, method influence everythng from my design to analysis. As a data scientist, information 
    through graphical analysis helps create a more knowledgeable and inspirational society. Having experience 
    in programming such as Excel, VBA, Python, and Tableau to 3D drafting and rendering, I incorporate combined 
    technical strengths, visualization, and an ever-evolving skill set and offer a unique and growing range of 
    technical competence.

    Outside of my pofessional life, I enjoy furniture design and building. I love being outside
    and enjoy riding bikes, running, and reading outdoors.  I love Chicago, the people, and the 
    environment this city provides, and would love to stay here. I have lived in the Northeast and
    Southeast, but feel like my home is in the Midwest.
